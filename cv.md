### Personal

Adventurer, love to explore and be outside. But I do a love a great movie (into sci-fi, comedies and overall stuff that makes you think) when the weather is crappy outside. 

I've also taken some extensive personality tests with focus on finding my natural strengths and talents, here are my results (if you are interested):
