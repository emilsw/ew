### EW inc. Growth, CRO, UX & Digital Analytics / Owner

*Independent contractor - April 2014 to Present*

I've worked with companies and products of various sizes and stages, from helping acquire first customers to boosting monthly revenues for 7-8 figure online businesses. Some of the companies Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with: [Quimbee](https://www.quimbee.com/) | [Custody X change](https://www.custodyxchange.com/) | [Isolta](https://www.isolta.fi/) | [Athletic Greens](https://athleticgreens.com) | [Baseballism](https://www.baseballism.com/) | [Marine Depot](https://www.marinedepot.com/)

* Helped double MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) for [quimbee.com](https://www.quimbee.com/) an online education company (recently named the #9 fastest growing education company in the United States by Inc magazine)

* Developed and ran number of optimisation and A/B testing programs, here are some A/B test examples: 

  * Usability improvements for an 8 figure e-commerce store: the cart had too many distractions (visitors were confused by various elements and calls-to-action) - I tested a more focused cart, it increased average revenue per visitor by 16.01% (you can see the before/after [here](https://www.goodui.org/evidence/test029))
  
  * Product page improvements for another e-commerce store: made products more compelling by emphasising that they are made of limited supply materials and offer lifetime warranty. Sales increased by  
  
  * Funnel improvements (user flow) for a web subscription service: was getting majority of their traffic from specific landing pages - visitors who landed on those pages had to go to another page to sign up (which lead to a lot of drop-offs in between) - we tested a signup form on the initial landing pages (so the visitors can sign up without going to another page) - the new signup conversion rate increased by 23.03%    
  
* [Helped successfully launch a membership site](https://leavingworkbehind.com/membership-site-case-study/) 

* Wrote expert articles on [A/B testing pitfalls](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/thinking-about-a-b-testing-for-your-client-read-this-first), [A/B testing strategy](), [Google Analytics](http://acquireconvert.com/shopify-analytics/) and [User research](https://lesschurn.io/saas-churn-university/getting-more-information)

* Did an A/B testing on Shopify [webinar](https://www.convert.com/academy/choose-b-testing-strategy-shopify-store/?utm_source=convert.com&utm_medium=website)
