Hi, I'm Emils. I'm a growth, product and marketing strategist. 

I specialise in CRO (conversion rate optimisation) - UX research, digital analytics and A/B testing. However I have experience in almost all aspects of digital growth from user aquisition to conversion and retention - PPC (Adwords, Bing ads, FB ads), email marketing, drip campaigns, product launches, onboarding and lifecyle, outreach, content creation, SEO and more. Including digital product development - wireframing, cocepts and mockups, exentensive user research, market analysis and web development. 

My background is unorthodox, I have a degree in finance and spent my first professional years working in the corporate world. After boredom and lack of challenge, I started a startup on the side with no experience whatsover. However along the way I picked up new skills which eventually led me to freelance. Below are the highlights of my career so far.

### EW inc. Growth, CRO, UX & Digital Analytics 

*Independent contractor - April 2014 to Present*

I've worked with companies and products of various sizes and stages (mostly SaaS and E-commerce) across different industries (law, education, supplements, sport's apparel, invocing and more). I've helped acquire first customers and boost conversions and profits for 7-8 figure online businesses. 

Some of the companies Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with: [Quimbee](https://www.quimbee.com/) | [Custody X change](https://www.custodyxchange.com/) | [Isolta](https://www.isolta.fi/) | [Athletic Greens](https://athleticgreens.com) | [Baseballism](https://www.baseballism.com/) | [Marine Depot](https://www.marinedepot.com/)

Here are some highlights of my work:

* [Helped double MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)](https://www.emilsw.com/articles/survey-case-study) for [quimbee.com](https://www.quimbee.com/) an online education company (recently named the #9 fastest growing education company in the United States by Inc magazine)

* Developed and lead a multilingual CRO and growth startegy for a SaaS company that was struggling in international markets which lead to a 3x increase in paid users in the market where the strategy was implemented

* Developed and led number of optimisation and A/B testing programs, some A/B test examples: 

  * Usability improvements for an 8 figure e-commerce store: the cart had too many distractions (visitors were confused by various elements and calls-to-action) - I tested a more focused cart, it increased average revenue per visitor by 16.01% (you can see the before/after [here](https://www.goodui.org/evidence/test029))
  
  * Product page improvements for another e-commerce store: made products more compelling by emphasising that they are made of limited supply materials and offer lifetime warranty. Ecommerce conversion rate increased by 28%
  
  * Funnel improvements (user flow) for a web subscription service: was getting majority of their traffic from specific landing pages - visitors who landed on those pages had to go to another page to sign up (which lead to a lot of drop-offs in between) - we tested a signup form on the initial landing pages (so the visitors can sign up without going to another page) - the new signup conversion rate increased by 23.03%    
  
* [Helped successfully launch a membership site](https://leavingworkbehind.com/membership-site-case-study/) 

* Created and promoted cotent: wrote expert articles on [A/B testing pitfalls](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/thinking-about-a-b-testing-for-your-client-read-this-first), [A/B testing strategy](), [Google Analytics](http://acquireconvert.com/shopify-analytics/) and [User research](https://lesschurn.io/saas-churn-university/getting-more-information). Did an A/B testing on Shopify [webinar](https://www.convert.com/academy/choose-b-testing-strategy-shopify-store/) 

* I've also done plenty of outbound marketing for my own services: prospecting, outreach, sales 
 

### Thrill Engine

*Founder - 2012 to 2013*

I created a [travel site](https://web.archive.org/web/20140125223539/http://www.thrillengine.com/trips/surf-tours-nicaragua) where you could book adventure trips for better prices. This is how I began my journey into the digital world and entrepreneurship.

I was a complete newbie so I made almost every possible mistake you can make and learned a lot of lessons the hard way. During this time I also picked up quite a few new skills from web development (HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails) to desing to marketing and sales. I learned everything from scratch and did everything by myself. Even though my own startup failed, I've successfully managed to use the lessons and newfound skills to pave the way for a freelance career.



### Aldaris, Part of Carlsberg Group 
*Procurement specialists - November 2008 to February 2014* 

Excel reports and a lot of emails and phone calls dealing with suppliers (worldwide) and collaboration with the marketing department (regarding the design of packaging and bottle labels). 

One of the key tasks was assisting with the implementation of SAP. I had to complete the training courses, and then teach my colleagues how to use SAP for their daily tasks (the procurement and production department).

Using the excel skills I acquired from my earlier position, I managed to optimize and automate a large part of the whole procurement process (80% of my work consisted of making orders for production materials from excel and SAP reports). It made it boring but there was one upside - it gave me free time to start working on my startup (see above).

### Aldaris, Part of Carlsberg Group
*Business Analysis Assistant - July 2007 to November 2008*

My first real job as a business analyst's assistant at a local brewery called Aldaris (which is also fully owned by The Carlsberg Group, a global brewer employing around 41,000 people).

My duties consisted mostly of doing sales reports in excel. Learned a few excel tricks and managed to optimize the whole reporting process - faster reports, less manual work which soon led to a promotion.

### Education

#### BA School of Business and Finance, Riga, Latvia
* Bachelor's degree of finance and accounting - June 2009*
