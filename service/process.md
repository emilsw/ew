# How it works #

Thanks again for your interest. I’d love you to read all the information on this page as it will build consensus right away, allowing us to have a solid working relationship going forward.

Email at <mailto:emils.veveris@gmail.com> anytime if you have any questions.

## Payment ##

You should expect to pay your first three months upfront but with a 10% discount. 

If you’re unsatisfied with me for any reason after three months, I’ll provide you with a full refund of your most recent month’s payment. I stand behind all the work that I do.

But If you are happy and you wish to proceed you can choose to continue to pay per quarter (every 3 months) which includes the 10% discount.

Or on a monthly basis. 

I prefer using [transferwise.com](https://transferwise.com/business) to process payments. Unfortunately it will not be automatic and it will require for you to create an account. But it’s very simple, just follow the steps here: [https://transferwise.com/business](https://transferwise.com/business)

After every payment, I’ll send you an invoice.
 
I strongly prefer it for following reasons:

* Best rates and smaller fee’s. 
* Faster and simpler (it takes far less days for money to come into my bank account comparing to paypal).
 
Unfortunately Stripe is not yet available in my country.

## Onboarding You (Our first week together) ##

Once you’ve paid, I’ll:

 * Set up a Trello board for us to coordinate our activity, it will feature a to do list for each month (you’ll get invitations to your email).
 * You give me access to all the analytics tools, surveys, data you already have.
 * I’ll ask you to complete a form with more detailed questions about your business (to figure out the right objectives and goals for this project)
 * Set up an account on hotjar.com (I use it for surveys, polls, heatmaps, user video sessions).
 * Set up an account for us on Convert.com or Optimizely.com (or any other tool you choose to work with).
 * I start the research.

The goal is to develop a 6 month optimization plan during the first month and start testing during the second month.

##The Research##

This is the vital part, this is where all the good testing ideas will come from. In short, here are some of things I’ll be doing:

 * Analytics health check: is everything being measured, is everything accurate.
 * Analyse Google Analytics to find ‘where’ the website is underperforming and where I should start optimizing.
 * Check key pages for relevancy, motivation, friction issues.
 * Examine the click patterns using heat maps, scroll maps to see how the visitors use the site. 
 * Read and analyse thousands of survey responses (feedback pools, exit surveys to learn more about your customers).

Once I know what is happening, I’ll be able to come up with more effective solutions and test them. I will keep you posted about all my findings and you’ll get access to all of the data and insights.

##Optimization game plan##

Turning those insights into action. It will be a simple google docs spreadsheet that will feature:

 * Objectives (what we will be hoping to accomplish: lift in conversion rate and revenue..).
 * Round of a/b tests for the next 6 months.
 
A simple game plan that I will be executing in order to grow your conversion rate and revenue.

##Tools##

I’ll be using a few tools to roll out tests, make changes, and coordinate our work together.

**Trello**

I’ll use Trello to post  research findings, coordinate on future tests, notify each other of our availability, and critique our work together. Trello is a great email substitute, because it ensures a long-lasting, group-visible record of all our work together.

I’m happy to invite as many people as appropriate to Trello; just let me know their email addresses. (You can also invite them yourself.)

**Convert.com and Optimizely.com**

Unless you have your own A/B testing account, I’ll use one of my accounts at Convert.com 

You’ll be required to add a snippet of JavaScript to your code.

**Analytics tools**

I’d like to be granted access to your analytics tools.
You can give Google Analytics access to <emils.veveris@gmail.com> 
Access to other analytics suites (KISSmetrics, Mixpanel, Mint, etc.) also use <emils.veveris@gmail.com>

This is so I can determine how your conversion funnels are working, and what pages are getting enough traffic to perform statistically significant tests.

**Hotjar.com**

A powerful tool for getting detailed feedback about your website, visitors and customers.

You’ll be required to add a snippet of JavaScript to your code as well.

**Other tools**

I may be using some other tools for deeper research or experiment with some that might help me execute my service better. In any case, I will let you know about this upfront. 

-------

###My Availability###

I work Monday through Friday, between 12pm and 10pm EET (Eastern Europe Time) (compare your timezone to ours).
 
If you contact us outside of those times, I might not respond as quickly as usual. But I’ll always do my best to respond within 24 hours. If you’d like to have a chat, it’s best to book a time.

Like everybody, I also take vacation from time to time. Barring any personal emergencies, you’ll know about my vacation plans at least one month in advance.

Expect intermittent availability around most holidays like Christmas and New Year’s. 

-------

###A Few Questions You Might Have###

**How long will each A/B test run for?**

I run each test for a minimum of 3-4 weeks regardless of traffic levels and conversion rates. This provides the highest possibility that any changes (positive or negative) the test results indicate will also occur if you make the changes permanent.

**How many A/B test tests will I get per month?**

I average 1-2 tests per month. Most tests are run for 3-4 weeks to ensure valid results. The number of tests we perform each month depends on the size and changes required for each test.

**How long before the first A/B test is live?**

During the second month. The first month is set aside for my extensive research process that enables me to create more winning tests than the industry average. It takes time to fully understand your business and customers, integrate with your technology, and evaluate your analytics (or setup/fix your analytics if required).

**Who will write the copy or create the designs when making the changes to my website?**

Copywriting, design and front end coding are all included when testing. If any updates require changes to the back end I’ll discuss this with you and plan the best course of action together. You’ll be responsible for taking the changes from winning tests and making them permanent in your website (you’ll have full access to all work we’ve created).

**What happens when we get a positive result from an A/B test?**

First we give each other a round of high fives … then I start the next test on the list from our optimization game plan. 

**What happens when we get a negative result from an A/B test?**

The same, I move on to the next test on the list. But while the new test is running, I’m digging in to learn why it went wrong and to figure out if we need to do a retest with some changes for the next round.   

**How long will it take before I see results?**

It’s different for everyone, depending on your situation it can take between 3-8 months before you see a significant return on your investment. 

To put it simply, the more traffic and monthly transactions you have the quicker you’ll see the results.
