Hi Corvin,

You may have heard that shopping cart abandonment is the main reason [why online retailers are losing 68.53% of sales](http://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate) (that's a lot of money). The good news is that with a few fixes you can get some of that money back.

I looked at <https://www.slow-watches.com/checkout/cart/> and here are some simple things you can change to improve it and boost your revenue:

 **1. Make it more obvious what you want them to do on this page (make your main CTA stand out)** 

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fUc4-eD0eUqs23XomLN2wq28ZlHe0-mIgPz4yHs32aYFw1j7OsjjC-S-vUnfMlwSSqVVDi_fTOqZS26CapztJjyQ78dfKCma8sQk4jCxFR5Duknce09j1rrvJAOgcIpFpbtK3CS2" width="700">

The good thing is it’s the biggest button on the page. But it still blends with the rest of the page (it’s not clear if you want me to click on it). Your goal is to make it painfully clear what you want them to do here. So simply change the button color and instead of a simple “Checkout” which almost sounds like a command, try something that’s friendlier and more reassuring, like “Continue to secure checkout”.

 **2. Avoid any confusion**

<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FzBFZJhJ-PL0HIh1RFfJgyK_5rr0Ie4CIt-HPiMkORNB4SIx9BUSVvv6Sw8LgnCFXyf0vwwN4uJJW_2bc6d9reFWDhvB_pW9PZ7Vq02-QNYhyH-iNN8x7WwqyuR25IOZ3KdYTC1Y" width="700">

What is this huge image? And why it’s so huge? I assume it’s the box for the watch but it wasn’t clear instantly. But what is it doing there? Visitors want to see what’s in their shopping cart and how much it’s going to cost them and you don’t want them to see something big that they did not expect to see.

 **3. Is it free worldwide shipping? (Be clear about it).**

Lot’s of stores offer free shipping but only to domestic customers. So majority of international online shopper are somewhat used to the fact that they will probably need to pay for shipping. This is a huge benefit, don’t be shy about… clearly state that you offer free ‘worldwide’ shipping.
 
 **4. Show related products:**

You are already doing this in your product pages but why not do it in your shopping cart as well? This only increase the chances that the customer will actually buy an additional band. Good Examples:

**So what’s next?**

Here’s your new optimized page (based on my suggestions):

What I changed exactly:

**What kind of results to expect from these changes?**

Honestly, it's hard to tell …. you need to A/B test that (and I only did a partial research, there are a few more ways to improve it). But here's a recent case study featuring similar changes for marinedepot.com:

<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/9Kiy7bbuMZHyOLxZIrAE_rFMG30fmkgn1Li2aYE8GV3xvIWpBuyQ-NiMH-Zz8YiYC3AE_5wdmU6_jhk1MgMojCeoAXjgFteQBBPdArhD7-2wl83q08Kxt8kY04uNZ4Q4Rxvukra9" width="700">

This is from an actual A/B test. A is the original version, B is the improved version. Here are the final results (after 4 weeks of testing):

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_o7aXxTB845_f6Q-Wz6a14_BU9ZxvIGSzTyEm9IlkNLODOiqjxfssyZvCCQqrTnq2f-TI9Lbha3pCQMZGPcgqR26Gy_LcGIQiXSWhsPaj-HfrL__KISdCnb3e-N-y94bk2X_Pt5D" width="700">

**+12.33%** increase in revenue might not seem much, but the changes were small and this increase means approximately 3 million dollars in additional annual revenue for them.

Just think about what just a 2% or 10% improvement for each checkout page would do for your business...

If you keep testing and optimizing, you may possible be looking at 20 - 30% (or even more) increase in sales over the next 6 months.

It also reduces the cost of your traffic efforts (PPC, SEO, social media) as you get more money back from your website.

. . .

But this may not be your highest priority for your business right now. You’ve got ton of other things on your plate. Optimization does take a lot of time and there are many ways it can go wrong (e.g. not all tests produce meaningful results).

Let me help you.

With my service, I will do everything you need to do:

 * Research your website and analytics to find out where exactly are you loosing customers and which pages should you optimize.
 * Understand your visitors/customers (what motivates them, why they buy and why they don't buy).
 * Make improvements to your pages based on the insights from the research.
 * Run A/B tests to make sure that new changes will actually result in more money for you.
 * Rinse and repeat (optimization is an ongoing process, with each test and each change you get new data that will be help you further improve your site).

What you get:

 * A free ($29/month) account on [**Convert.com**](http://www.convert.com/). I’m a certified specialist.
 * A free ($33/month) pro account on [**Hotjar.com**](https://www.hotjar.com/). A powerful research tool.
 * Access to all the research material. Heatmaps, scrollmaps, survey results, user sessions replays...valuable information on how your site is actually used and who your customers really are (knowing this will help you become better at marketing your products).
 * Optimization plan for the next 6 months (list of proposed A/B tests and changes based on the insights I found that will help you grow your business).
 * A/B test for the following month. I set up, run and monitor the test.

To put it simply, I’ll focus on improving <https://www.slow-watches.com> every month so you can focus on running your business.

**How much is this?**

I have several plans and it ranges from $1500 - $3000/month, tailored to each of my clients to better serve the volume of the traffic and monthly transactions. 

So let’s talk about the potential outcome first (how much more revenue can I help you grow) and then I’ll give you a price that's fair compensation for that growth for your business. 

And I’d like to work with you for an initial three-month engagement, in order to gauge whether we’d be a good fit.

And if you’re unsatisfied with me for any reason after three months, **I’ll provide you with a full refund of your most recent month’s payment.** I stand behind all the work that I do.

**ROI focused**

The goal is to make your money back by a minimum of 3x your investment (my clients are getting way more than that). For every test, I closely follow and report how much more money am I helping you make.
. . . .
