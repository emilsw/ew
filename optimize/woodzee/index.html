				<p>Hey Luke,</p>
				
				<p>One of the best places to start testing is your checkout funnel, for following reasons:</p>
           <ul>
             <li><p> It has the most qualified traffic (visitors showed an interest in buying your products); </p> </li>
             <li><p> The highest conversion rate (meaning you can get away with a smaller sample size); </p></li>
             <li><p> And small changes can lead to big improvements ( I’ll share how I was able to improve the revenue by 12.33% for marinedepot.com with simple changes in their shopping cart. Find the case study below.) </p></li>
           </ul>

        <p> I looked at <a href="www.woodzee.com/checkout/cart/"> www.woodzee.com/checkout/cart/ </a> and here are some simple things you can improve and boost your revenue: </p>

        <p> (Normally I would start with the one that’s leaking the most money by checking your analytics but since I don’t see that, I’m starting with the first step.) </p>
        
           <ol>
              <li> <p> <b> Make it enclosed </b> </p> </li>
             
             <p> You are wasting clicks. When people start the checkout process you want them to finish it, so you want to eliminate the links and clicks that lead to somewhere else (in your case that’s your header and footer). </p>
             
             <li> <p> <b>Make your main CTA stand out (use a different color)  </b> </p> </li>
             
             <p> It should always be obvious how things work. Right now, you need to look for the “proceed to checkout” button, which is the most important button on this page. You don’t want people to leave your site just because they didn’t know how to complete the checkout. Your main buttons should be bold and visible and guide the visitors. </p>
             
             <li> <p> <b> Hide the coupon code </b> </p> </li>
             
             <p> This is a huge distraction, once people see this, they go to google to search for the coupon… and lot’s of them won’t come back (because they couldn’t find it). Instead, have a text link saying “Got a coupon?” or something similar, and clicking on the link makes an input field – like the one above – appear. Text links are not visually very prominent, so less people will pay attention to them. </p>
             
             <li> <p> <b> Remind them about free shipping. </b> </p> </li>
             
             <p> Next to your shipping calculator, you need to remind the visitors that it’s free for US shoppers to avoid any confusing. Shipping costs is the #1 reason for cart abandonment so you want to be as clear as possible. </p>
             
             <li> <p> <b> Remind them about security </b> </p> </li>
             
             <p> Security is a serious concern for many people, your job is to remind them that all the information they give you is safe and secure. </p>
             
             <li> <p> <b> Save cart content for longer period. </b> </p> </li>
             
             <p> I added a product in my cart and left, came back a few hours later and saw that my cart is empty. </p>

             <p> Lot of people are not spontaneous shoppers, they like to take their time. Compare similar products and then maybe come back later and finish the purchase (it can take even days). But if you make them do all the steps all over again they might not do it…. people are lazy after all. </p>

             <p> Set it up to 30 days. </p>

             </ol>

        <p> <b> Bonus tip: </b> </p>

        <p> Use cart abandonment emails and retargeting ads to bring people during those 30 days and continue where they left off. </p>

        <p> <b> So what’s next? </b> </p>

        <p>Here’s your new page (based on my suggestions):</p>
        
        <p> what I changed exactly: </p>
        
        <p> Open your A/B testing tool, make the changes and run the test (following these guidelines to ensure valid results) </p>
