				<p>Hey Luke,</p>
				
				<p>One of the best places to start testing is your checkout funnel, for following reasons:</p>
           <ul>
             <li><p> It has the most qualified traffic (they’ve showed an interest in buying your products); </p> </li>
             <li><p> The highest conversion rate (meaning you can get away with a smaller sample size); </p></li>
             <li><p> And small changes can lead to big improvements ( I’ll share how I was able to improve the revenue by 12.33% for marinedepot.com with simple changes in their shopping cart. Find the case study below.) </p></li>
           </ul>

        <p> I looked at <a href="www.woodzee.com/checkout/cart/"> www.woodzee.com/checkout/cart/ </a> and here are some simple things you can improve and boost your revenue: </p>

        <p> (Normally I would start with the one that’s leaking the most money by checking your analytics but since I don’t see that, I’m starting with the first step.) </p>
        
           <ol>
             <p> <li> <b> Make it enclosed </b> </li> </p>
             
             <p> You are wasting clicks. When people start the checkout process you want them to finish it, so you want to eliminate the links and clicks that lead to somewhere else (in your case that’s your header and footer). </p>
             
             <li> <p> <b>Make your main CTA stand out (use a different color)  </b> </p> </li>
             
             <p> It should always be obvious how things work. Right now, you need to look for the “proceed to checkout” button, which is the most important button on this page. You don’t want people to leave your site just because they didn’t know how to complete the checkout. Your main buttons should be bold and visible and guide the visitors. </p>
