Hi Tyler,

You may have heard that shopping cart abandonment is the main reason [why online retailers are loosing 68.53% of sales](http://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate) (that's a lot of money). The good news is that with a few fixes you can get some of that money back.

I looked at (http://angelusdirect.com/cart) and here are some simple things you can change to improve it and boost your revenue:

(Normally I would start with the one that’s leaking the most money by checking your analytics but since I don’t see that, I’m starting with the first step.)


 **1. Make your main button (CTA- call to action) stand out** 



It should always be obvious how things work. Right now, you need to look for the “proceed to checkout” button, which is the most important button on this page. You don’t want people to leave your site just because they didn’t know how to complete the checkout. Your main buttons should be bold and visible and guide the visitors.

 **2. Be clear about the pricing (and shipping)**


This is the most important part of the page. When people check their carts they want to know how much it’s going to cost them. Right now it’s a little confusing, there’s is no summary… and it’s hard to find it out what are the shipping costs. 

 **3. Remove distractions (make it enclosed)**


You are wasting clicks. When people start the checkout process you want them to finish it, so you want to eliminate the links and clicks that lead to somewhere else (in your case that’s your header and footer).


 **4. Remind about security**

Security is a serious concern for many people, your job is to remind them that all the information they give you is safe and secure.

**Bonus tip:**

Show related products in the cart. Especially if you are notifying how much they need to spend to qualify for free shipping, make it easy to add more products. Good Examples:



P.S.

Good job on following up (awesome email :)):




**So what’s next?**

Here’s your new optimized page (based on my suggestions):



What I changed exactly:








**What kind of results to expect from these changes?**

Honestly, it's hard to tell …. you need to A/B test that (and I only did a partial research, there are a few more ways to improve it). But here's a recent case study featuring similar changes for marinedepot.com:


This is from an actual A/B test. A is the original version, B is the improved version. Here are the final results (after 4 weeks of testing):



**+12.33%** increase in revenue might not seem much, but the changes were small and this increase means approximately 3 million dollars in additional annual revenue for them.

Just think about what just a 2% or 10% improvement for each checkout page would do for your business...

If you keep testing and optimizing, you may possible be looking at 20 - 30% increase in sales over the next 6 months.

. . .

But this may not be your highest priority for your business right now. You’ve got ton of other things on your plate. Optimization does take a lot of time and there are many ways it can go wrong (e.g. not all tests produce meaningful results).

Let me help you.

With my service, I will do everything you need to do:

 * Research your website and analytics to learn where are the biggest source of gains(missed opportunities).
 * Understand your visitors/customers (what motivates them, why they buy and why they don't buy).
 * Create improved versions of your pages based on the insights from the research.
 * Run A/B tests to make sure that new changes will actually result in more money for you.
 * Rinse and repeat (optimization is an ongoing process, with each test and each change you get new data that will be help you further improve your site).

What you get:
 * A free ($29/month) account on Convert.com. I’m a certified specialist.
 * A free ($33/month) pro account on Hotjar.com. A powerful research tool.
 * Access to all the research material. Heatmaps, scrollmaps, survey results, user sessions replays...valuable information on how your site is actually used and who your customers really are.
 * Optimization plan for the next 6 months (list of proposed A/B tests and changes based on the insights I found that will help you grow your business).
 * A/B test for the following month. I set up, run and monitor the test.

To put it simply, I’ll focus on improving http://angelusdirect.com/ every month so you can focus on running your business.

**How much is this?**

I have several plans and it ranges from $1500 - $3000/month, tailored to each of my clients to better serve the volume of the traffic and monthly transactions. 

So let’s talk about the potential outcome first (how much more revenue can I help you grow) and then I’ll give you a price that's fair compensation for that growth for your business. 

And I’d like to work with you for an initial three-month engagement, in order to gauge whether we’d be a good fit.

And if you’re unsatisfied with me for any reason after three months, **I’ll provide you with a full refund of your most recent month’s payment.** I stand behind all the work that I do.

**ROI focused**

The goal is to make your money back by a minimum of 3x your investment (I did way more for my previous clients).  For every test, I closely follow and report how much more money am I helping you make.
. . . . 

If any of this sounds appealing to you, just reply to my email and we can figure out a time to chat a little more! And if you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks for reading.

Cheers,
