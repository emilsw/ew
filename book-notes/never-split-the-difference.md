## Summary



## My notes

When deliberating on a negotiation strategy or approach, people tend to focus all their energies on what to say or do, but it's how we are (our general demeanor and delivery) that is both the easiest thing to enact and the most immediately effective mode of influence.

In most cases, your assertive voice will signal dominance onto your counterpart, who will either aggressively, or passive - aggressively, push back against attempts to be controlled.

A smile, even while talking one the phone, has an impact tonally that the other person will pick upon.

Talking slowly and clearly you convey one idea: I'm in control

The intentions behind most mirror should be “Please, help me understand”. Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they've said.

“What do you mean by that?” - you'll incite irritation or defensiveness

People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle, it is a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.

How can you separate people from the problem when their emotions are the problem? Once people get upset at one another, rational thinking goes out the window.

A soothing voice, close listening, and a calm repetition of the words of your ''patient'' can get you a lot further than a cold, rational argument. 

(Tactical empathy)

Labelling is a way of validating someone's emotion by acknowledging it. Give someone's emotion a name and you show you identify with how that person feels. Labeling an emotion - applying rational words to a fear - disrupts its own intensity. 

How:
* It seems like ___
* It sounds like ___
* It looks like ___

Tactic vs strategy? Spoon is a great tool for stirring soup but it's not a recipe.

Emotions has two levels:
The presenting behavior - the surface you can see and hear
The underlying feeling - what motivates the behavior 

Anger is rarely productive. It releases stress hormones and neurochemicals that disrupt your ability to properly evaluate and respond to situations. 

The fastest and most efficient means of establishing a quick working relationship is to acknowledge the negative and diffuse it.

Research shows that the best way to deal with negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgement. Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, and solution based thoughts.

Empathy + connection.

I say, “In case you're worried about volunteering to role-play with me in front of the class, I want to tell you in advance …. It's going to be horrible.”

After the laughter dries down, I then say, “and those of you who do volunteer will probably get more out of this than anyone else”

I always end up with more volunteers than I need.

In any interaction, it pleases us to feel that the other side is listening and acknowledging our situation … 

Empathy doesn't demand (or mean) that you agree with the other person's ideas (you may well find them crazy). But by acknowledging the other person's situation, you immediately convey that you are listening.

The word “no” is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it. It seldom means, “I have considered all the facts and made a rational choice.” Instead, “no” is often a decision, frequently temporary, to maintain the status quo. Change is scary, and ''no''provides a little protection from that scariness.

People have a deep and universal need for autonomy. People need to feel in control. When you preserve a person's autonomy by cleary giving them permission to say “No” to your ideas, the emotions calm, the effectiveness of the decisions go up, and the other party can really look at your proposal. They're allowed to hold it in their hands, to turn it around. And it gives you time to elaborate or pivot in order to convince your counterpart that the change you're proposing is more advantageous than the status quo. 

“No” - meanings:
I am not yet ready to agree;
You are making me feel uncomfortable;
I do not understand;
I don't think I can afford it;
I want something else;
I need information; or
I want to talk it over with someone else

Solution-based questions (or simply label their effect):
“What about this doesn't work for you?”
“What would you need to make it work?”
“It seems like there's something here that bothers you …”

There are actually three kinds of  “Yes”: Counterfeit, confirmation, and commitment (commitment “Yes” is the real deal)

Whether you call it “buy-in” or “engagement” or something else, good negotiators know that their job isn't to put on a great performance but to gently guide their counterpart to discover their goal as his own.

The only way to get these callers to take action was to have them own the conversation, to believe that they were coming to these conclusions, to these necessary next steps, and that the voice at the other end was simply a medium for those realizations.

In every negotiation, in every agreement, the result comes from someone else's decision. And sadly, if we believe that we can control or manage other's decisions with compromise and logic; we're leaving millions on the table. But while we can't control others decisions, we can influence them by inhabiting their world and seeing and hearing exactly what they want. 

Everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges: the need to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control.

Primal needs are urgent and illogical, so arguing them into a corner is just going to push your counterpart to flee with a counterfeit “Yes”.

“No” starts conversations and creates safe havens to get to the final “Yes” of commitment. And early “Yes” is often just a cheap, counterfeit dodge. 


A “No” gives the speaker the feeling of safety, security, and control. You use a question that prompts a “No” to start, as a sign that the other party is engaged and thinking.

Go for a “Yes” straight off the bat, though, and your counterpart gets defensive, wary, and skittish.

“Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Instead ask, “Is now a bad time to talk?”

One great way to force a “No”, is to mislabel the other party's emotions or desires. You say something that you know is totally wrong like “So it seems that you really are eager to leave your job” when they clearly want to stay. That forces them to listen and makes them comfortable by correcting you.

Another way to force “No” in a negotiation is to ask the other party what they don't want.

How to get an email reply (aka the magic email). You provoke a “No” with this one-sentence email: “Have you given up on this project?” 

A smile and a nod might signify “Get me out of here!” as much as it means “Nice to meet you.” 

Negotiations gain their power by understanding their counterpart's situation and extracting information about their counterpart's desires and needs. Extracting that information means getting the other party to disagree, to draw their own boundaries, to define their desires as a function of what they do not want. 

Don't aim for “Yes” at the start. Asking someone for “Yes” too quickly in a conversation - “Do you like to drink water, Mr. Smith?” - gets his guard up and points you as an untrustworthy salesman.

Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It's about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea.

BCSM - Behavioral Change Stairway Model 
The model proposes five stages - active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, and behavioral change - that take any negotiator from listening to influencing behavior.

The vast majority of us, however, as Carl Rogers (great American psychologist) explained, come to expect that love, praise, and approval are dependent on saying and doing the things people (initially, our parents) consider correct. That is, because for most of us the positive regard we experience us conditional, we develop a habit of hiding who we really are and what we really think, instead calibrating our words to gain approval but disclosing little.


Instead of “Yes” get to “that's right”

Why is “you're right” the worst answer?

Consider this: whenever someone is bothering you, and they just won't let up, and they won't listen to anything you have to say, what do you tell them to shut up and go away? “You're right”.

It works every time. Tell people “you're right” and they get a happy smile on their face and leave you alone for at least 24 hours. But you haven't agreed to their position.

“You seem to think it's unmanly to dodge a block,” I told him: “you think it's cowardly to get out of someone's way that's trying to hit you”

“That's right,” he said.


Use a summary to trigger “that's right”. The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing. Identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm “the world according to …. “


Negotiation is never a linear formula: add X to Y get Z. We all have irrational blind spots, hidden needs, and underdeveloped notions.

Once you understand that subterranean world of unspoken needs and thoughts, you'll discover a universe of variables that can be leveraged to change your counterpart's needs and expectations. From using some people's fear of deadlines and the mysterious power of odd numbers, to our misunderstood relationship to fairness, there are always ways to bend our counterpart's reality so it conforms to what we ultimately want to give them, not to what they initially think they deserve. 



A woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with his suit. But her husband doesn't want to;  he prefers brown shoes. So what do they do? They compromise, they meet halfway. And, you guessed it, he wears one black and one brown shoe. Is this the best outcome? Either of the two other outcomes - black or brown - would be better than the compromise.



We don't compromise because it's right, we compromise because it is easy and because it saves face. We compromise in order to say that at least we got half the pie. Distilled to its essence, we compromise to be safe. Most people in a negotiation are driven by fear or by the desire to avoid pain. Too few are driven by their actual goals.

So don't settle and - here's a simple rule - never split the difference. Creative solutions are almost always preceded by some degree of risk, annoyance, confusion, and conflict. Accommodation and compromise produce none of that. 

You've got to embrace the hard stuff. That's where the great deals are.



Whether your deadline is real and obsolete or merely a line in the sand, it can trick you into believing that doing a deal now is more important than getting a good deal. Deadlines regularly make people say and do impulsive things that are against their best interests, because we all have a natural tendency to rush as a deadline approaches ….

The perception of the loss we'll incur in the future - “The deal is off!” our mind screams at us in some imaginary future scenario - should no resolution be achieved by a certain point in time.


If you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong. I say, “That's not empathy, that's projection …”

Why, I ask, did none of the proposers offer $1, which is the best rational offer for them and logically unrejectable for the accepter? And if they did and they got rejected - which happens - why did the accepter turn them down?”

“Anyone who made any offer other than 1$ made an emotional choice” I say. “And for you accepters who turned down $1, since when is getting 0$ better than getting $1?

In Descarte's Error: Emotion, reason, and the human brain, neuroscientists Antonio Damasia explained a groundbreaking discovery he made. Studying people who had damaged in the part of the brain where emotions are generated, he found that they all had something peculiar in common: They couldn't make decisions. They could describe what they should do in logical terms, but they found it impossible to make even the simplest choice.

In other words, while we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision making is governed by emotion. 

Derisory - ridiculously small or inadequate

Most people make an irrational choice to let the dollar slip through their fingers rather than to accept a derisory offer, because the negative emotional value of unfairness outrights the positive rational value of the money.

Fairness is a powerful motivation.

There are three ways that people drop this F-bomb, only one is positive.

1. The most common use is a judo-like defensive move that destabilizes the other side. Something like, “we just want what's fair.”

It immediately triggers feelings of defensiveness and discomfort. These feelings are often subconscious and often lead to an irrational concession.

2. The second F bomb is more nefarious. In this one, your counterpart will basically accuse 
You of being dense or dishonest by saying, “we've given you a fair offer. ” It's a terrible little jab meant to distract your attention and manipulate you into giving in. If you find yourself in this situation, the best reaction is to simply the “F” that has just been labeled at you. “Fair?” you'd respond, pausing to let the word's power do to them as it was intended to do to you. Follow that with a label: “It seems like you're ready to provide evidence that supports that” …
3. The last use of the F-word is positive and constructive. It sets the stage for honest and empathetic negotiation. 

Early in a negotiation, I say, “I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I'm being unfair, and we'll address it.”



What does a babysitter sell really?  It's not child care exactly, but a relaxed evening. 

Take the same person, change one or two variables, and $100 can be a glorious victory or a vicious insult. Recognizing this phenomenon lets you bend reality from insult to victory.

I have this coffee mug, what would you pay for it? You're probably going to say something like $3.50. Let's say it's your mug, you're going to sell it to me - you're probably going to say between $6 and $7.

In both cases it was the same mug. All I did was move the mug in relation to you, and I totally changed it's value.

Perspective - $20 for an errand (an hours work) sounds awesome. But if you find out that that errand made $4m, then it's not so awesome anymore.



By far the best theory for describing the principles of our irrational decisions is something called Prospect Theory. Created in 1979 by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice - that's called the certainty effect. And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That's called loss aversion.

A person who's told he has a 95% chance of receiving $10000 or a 100% chance of getting $9,499 will usually avoid risk and take the 100% certain choice. While the same person who's told he has a 95% chance of losing $10000 or a 100% chance of losing $9,499 will make the opposite choice, risking the bigger 95% option to avoid the loss.



To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.



Start with an accusation audit acknowledging their all fears.

“ I got a lousy proposition for you”. I said, and paused until each asked me to go on.

“You're going to think I'm a lousy businessman. You're going to think I can't budget or plan. You're going to think Chris Voss is a big talker. His first big project ever out of the FBI, he screws it up completely. He doesn't know how to run an operation. And he might even had lied to me. Still, I wanted to bring this opportunity to you before I took it to someone else”.



Researchers have discovered that we tend to make adjustments from our first reference points. For example, most people glimpsing 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 estimate that it yields higher result than the same string in reverse order. That's because we focus on the first number and extrapolate

Extrapolate - extend the application of (a method or conclusion, especially one based on statistics) to an unknown situation by assuming that existing trends will continue or similar methods will be applicable.




Instead of saying, “I'm worth $110,000”, Jerry might have said, “At top places like X corp, people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000.

In a recent study, Columbia Business School psychologists found that job applications who named a range received significantly higher overall salaries than those who offered a number.


When you do talk numbers, use odd ones. Anything you throw out that sounds less rounded - say, $37,263 - feels like a figure that you came to a result of thoughtful calculation. 



Surprise with a gift - reciprocity

You can get your counterpart into mood of generosity by staking an extreme anchor and then after their inevitable first rejection, offering them a wholly unrelated surprise gift.



Ask: “What does it take to be successful here?”

The key issue here is if someone gives you guidance, they will watch to see if you follow their advice. They will have a personal stake in seeing you succeed. You've just recruited your first unofficial mentor.



And the secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control. 


You don't directly persuade them to see your ideas. Instead, you ride them to your ideas


Giving your counterpart the illusion of control by asking calibrated questions - by asking for help - is one of the most powerful tools for suspending unbelief.



What's so powerful about the senior doctor's technique is that he took what was a showdown - ”I'm going to leave” versus “you can't leave” - and asked questions that led the patient to solve his own problem … in the way doctor wanted.

Joint problem solving …

“How am I supposed to do that?”

The client would hear the words and not this implication as long as she kept calm and avoided making it sound by her delivery like an accusation or threat. As long as she stayed cool, they would hear it as a problem to be solved.

Why did you do it? => “What caused you to do it?”

What is the biggest challenge you face?
What about this is important to you?
How can I help to make this better for us?
How would you like me to proceed?
What is it that brought us into this situation?
How can we solve this problem?
What's the objective? What are we trying to accomplish here?
How am supposed to do that?

Who has control in a conversation, the guy listening or the guy taking? The listener, of course.

Don't try to force your opponent to admit that you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation. 

Avoid questions that can be answered with “Yes” or tiny pieces of information. These require little thought and inspire the human need for reciprocity.


People always make more effort to implement a solution when they think it's theirs. That is simply human nature. That's why negotiation is often called “the art of letting someone else have your way.” 

How will we know we're on track?
How will we address things if we find we're off track?


A surprising high percentage of negotiations hinge on something outside dollars and cents, often having more to do with self-esteem, status, and other non financial needs.

How will this affect the rest of your team?
How on-board are the people not on this call?
What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?


7-38-55 Rule

UCLA professor Albert Mehrabian (creator) 

Only 7% of a message is based on the words while 38% comes from the tone of voice and 55% from the speaker's body language and face.

I heard you say, “Yes”, but it seemed like there was a hesitation in your voice

The rule of three - getting the other party to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation.

1: Initial
2: Summary
3: “What do we do if we got off track?” (calibrated questions)

3 kinds of “Yes”: commitment, confirmation, and counterfeit. 


The Pinocchio effect

Just like Pinocchio's nose, the number of words grew along with the lie.

The more in love they are with “I”, “me”, and “my” the less important they are. And vice versa.
 

“Let's put price off to the side for a moment and talk about what would make this a good deal”. Or “what else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?”


“That's a very generous offer given your budget limits, but I am not sure how that would help us achieve a great reception for the alums in the region”

“I have a very high amount in my head: $1000 is what we need.”

“I think your offer is very reasonable and I understand your restrictions, but I need more money to put on a great show for the school,” he said “How about $775?”

“I need $737.50 to make this work and you are my last stop”



“Well, if you go to Harvard Business School, they're going to charge you $2,500 a day per student”



The person across the table is never the problem. The unresolved issue is.
When you want to counteract unproductive statements from your counterpart, you can say, “I feel ____ when ____ because ____, “ and that demands a time-out from the other person. 



Akerman bargaining

Set your target price (your goal)
Set your first offer at 65% of your target price
Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95 and 100 percent) 
Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer
When calculating the final amount, use precise, non round numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight
On your final number, throw in a non monetary item (that they probably won't want) to show you're at your limit.


When the pressure is on, you don't rise to the occasion. You fall to your highest level of preparation.  



Leverage is the ability to inflict loss and withhold gain. Where does your counterpart want to gain and what do they fear losing? Discover these pieces of information, we are told, and you'll build leverage over the other side's perceptions, actions, and decisions. In practice, where our irrational perceptions are our reality, loss and gain are slippery notions, and it often doesn't matter what leverage actually exists against you; what really matters is the leverage they think you have on them.

To get leverage, you have to persuade your counterpart that they have something real to lose if the deal falls through…


Three types of leverage: positive, negative, normative

Positive leverage is quite simply you ability as a negotiator to provide - or withhold - things that your counterpart wants. 

Negative leverage is negotiator's ability to make his counterpart suffer. 

Normative leverage is using the other party's norms and standards to advance your position. If you can show inconsistencies between their beliefs and actions, you have normative leverage. 

If you got both ends covered, you'll be ready for anything - you'll know what you cannot accept and have an idea about the best case outcome, but keep in mind since there's information yet to be acquired from the other side, it's possible that best case might be even better than you know.
