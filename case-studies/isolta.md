Full case study coming soon.


>*<strong> Emils helped us gain growth in Latvia - significant increases in new free users and paying users </strong>. We gained valuable knowledge and deeper insight about the Latvian market (our end customers, local invoicing norms and standards). We have also been able to apply the learnings we’ve got from his work in our other locations as well.*
>
>*We are very satisfied with the progress we have seen as a result of our cooperation. Without the Emils, who has knowledge about local norms, standards, culture and language as well as growth marketing competence and valuable networks, we hadn’t been able to achieve the growth we’re seeing now.*
>
>*Working with Emils has been a pleasure - always easily reachable, systematic, competent, results oriented and reliable. Just easy to work with. Would definitely recommend working with him.”*
