theyconvert.com was a two-person tiny CRO agency (back in 2014), we worked with various e-commerce stores like [marinedepot.com](https://www.marinedepot.com/)

### What I did

* Lead generation and agency growth strategy
* Project & account management
* Designed and developed CRO and A/B testing processes
* Conducted conversion research (full data analysis, Google analytics audits, mouse tracking analysis,  UX research, user interviews, polls, etc.)
* A/B Testing (ideation, planning, prioritization, execution and QA)
* Reporting

Here's one example A/B test I designed and executed:

The cart for an 8 figure e-commerce  store had too many distractions (visitors were confused by various elements and calls-to-action), I designed and tested a more focused cart which increased the revenue per visitor by 12.33% (which was worth almost extra $3,000,000 in annual revenue)
