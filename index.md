##  Hi! I'm Emils, I can help you optimize your website's conversion rate and grow your profits ##

Here's the bottom line: you really have just two choices when it comes to growing your online business: 

 - Get more visitors (SEO, PPC, social media, content marketing, ads and etc.);
 - Get more money from your existing visitors and customers (optimization).

Sure, you need visitors foremost, but money spent on acquiring more of them disappears as soon as they leave without buying anything. 
Plus paid advertising is only getting more expensive and SEO is only getting harder....

&nbsp;

### Every day that passes you by is a day of lost potential revenue. ###

A healthy number of your visitors are perfectly ready to buy from you but for some reason they won't do it.

Tommorow, approximately the same amount of visitors (or even more) won’t buy either. 

This happens every day....

Think about how many sales you lose this way on a yearly basis, [people are losing millions](https://medium.com/@jasonfried/how-we-lost-and-found-millions-by-not-a-b-testing-e70f27dd783e). 

You are missing a lot of opportunities and if you only keep investing the money just in acquiring more traffic, this gap of missed opportunities just increases.

&nbsp;

### Money spent on optimization keeps coming back ###

If you start optimization today you will have far more revenue after 10 months ([and much more after 30 months](http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/10/08/what-spending-252000-on-conversion-rate-optimization-taught-me/)) than if you wait for another 10 months to start.

Even small changes to your copy or design can have a significant impact on the bottom line. 

Just a 5% improvement in sales each month is almost 80% improvement over 12 months (If you are wondering how that’s possible, it’s because of the [compounding interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest) effect).

And you will improve returns from all your other marketing efforts as your website will be more effective in converting visitors into customers. 

&nbsp;


### I can help ###

But where do you start? What exactly do you need to change? How do you make sure that you’re doing it right? And how do you make sure there’s a real improvement from your efforts?

There are lots of myths and faulty case studies out there. What works for others will not necessarily work for you, because your business is different.

There aren’t a lot of people who know how to make this really work and those who can are fully booked months in advance and rarely take on new clients. Top tier optimization agencies only work with businesses that generate more than $5 million/year and charge $15,000 to $20,000 per month for ongoing optimization.

Plus this may not be your highest priority for your business right now. You’ve got a ton of other things on your plate. Optimization does take a lot of time and there are many ways it can go wrong.

**Let me help save you hours of unnecessary trouble and frustration.** Let me work alongside you to make your business run smarter and more profitable.

With my service, I will do everything you need to do:

 - **Research your website and analytics** to find out where exactly are you losing customers.
 - **Understand your visitors/customers** to learn what motivates them, why they buy and why they don’t buy.
 - **Make improvements and suggestions** based on the insights from the research.
 - **Run A/B tests** to make sure that new changes will actually result in more money for you.
 - **Rinse and repeat** it's an iterative process, with each test and each change you get new data that will help you further improve your site.

If your investment in my services isn’t able to generate a return for you, I’ll fire myself. I don’t want you to waste your money if I can’t give you a good ROI.

&nbsp;

### Who is this for? ###

I’m looking for people who have great online businesses and are interested in long-term success on the web. But this isn’t for everyone, you should apply if:

 - You’re a small-to-mid-sized business with a revenue generating website.
 - You have enough traffic to support A/B testing. At least 10,000 unique visitors per month—and the more the better.
 - You’re serious about investing in strategies that will help you maximize your returns from your website.
 - You’re ready to set long-term goals, not just short-term goals.

&nbsp;

### What you get: ###

 - **A free ($29/month) account on Convert.com.** I’m a certified specialist.
 - **A free ($33/month) pro account on Hotjar.com.** A powerful research tool.
 - **Access to all the research material. Heatmaps**, scroll maps, survey results, user sessions replays…valuable information on how your site is actually used and who your customers really are (knowing this will help you become better at marketing your products).
 - **Optimization game plan** for the next 6 months (list of proposed A/B tests and changes based on the insights I found that will help you grow your business).
 - **A/B testing.** I set up, run and monitor the tests.

To put it simply, I’ll focus on improving your website every month so you can focus on running your business.

&nbsp;

### Are you any good at what you do? ###

I spent years figuring this stuff out on my own, made every possible mistake with my own projects, sifted through lots of websites, books, courses, closely followed and learned from top experts and personally experienced what works and what doesn’t work.

Here are some of the awesome businesses I've had the pleasure of working with:

### Pricing ###

I have several plans and it ranges from $1200 - $6000/month, tailored to each of my clients based on the volume of the traffic, number of monthly transactions and the potential outcome (how much more revenue can I help you grow).

So you’ll have to apply first and then I’ll give you a price that’s fair compensation for that growth for your business.

I’d like to work with you for an initial three-month engagement, in order to gauge whether we’d be a good fit.

And if you’re unsatisfied with me for any reason after three months, **I’ll provide you with a full refund of your most recent month’s payment**. I stand behind all the work that I do.

But please note as a solo consultant, there is a physical limit to how many clients I can service in a month. Therefore, at the moment I’ve got the capacity to take on **<span style="color:red">only <strike>three</strike> two new clients </span>**.


**ROI focused**

All I care about is how much profit I can drive to your business. The goal is to make your money back by a minimum of 10x your investment.
