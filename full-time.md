title: On the market for a full-time remote growth role
---

Hi, I'm Emils. I'm a multidisciplinary conversion rate optimization (CRO) & growth marketing expert.

Looking for growth manager, head of growth, growth product manager, CRO manager roles.

----

#### Background 

For the past five years I've been helping SaaS and E-commerce companies grow through better conversion rates and retention. 


#### Past work samples and results

* [Isolta](https://www.emilsw.com/case-studies/isolta): 400%+ growth in paying users for a B2B SaaS
* [Quimbee](https://www.emilsw.com/case-studies/quimbee): More than 2X increase in MRR and 3X in conversion rate in one year (recently named the #9 fastest growing education company in the US by Inc magazine)
* [Example E-commerce A/B test I designed](https://www.emilsw.com/case-studies/theyconvert): +12.33% increase in revenue per visitor (worth almost extra $3,000,000 in annual revenue) 

Looking to swith from consulting to full time product work to leave a bigger impact.

I see myself as an IC and/or in a management role. 

My main strengths and focuses are in growth strategies, online experiment design, UX research and data analysis. Creating/optimizing/analyzing systems, mechanisms and experiences that attract, convert and retain more and better/happier customers. 

But I have hands on experience in most disciplines of digital growth and product development (SEO, PPC, email marketing, outreach, lead generation, contention creation, UX/UI design, web development etc.)

#### In my spare time

Adventurer, love to explore, be outside and ride [boards](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bziwj1ihPri/) and bikes (all kinds). I read a lot (some of my favourite books: [Antifragile](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680), [Mastery](https://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/014312417X), [Obstacle is the way](https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358) ). I also a love a great movie (into sci-fi, comedies and overall stuff that makes you think) when the weather is crappy outside.


#### Things I like to do that helps businesses grow 

* Lead growth initiatives  
   * Develop and run growth/experimentation/optimization strategies and programs 
   * Improve conversions - A/B testing across every step of the funnel
   * Identify and work out growth loops
   * Improve User acquisition - test new channels, optimize your best ones
   * Improve User retention - onboarding, assist with product improvements
   * Refine and optimise your value proposition
* Set and measure the right metrics
   * Set KPIs, develop tracking plans, analyze performance and data 
* Run UX research that helps make better product, design, and marketing decisions
   * Figure out who is your ideal customer and what job is your product hired to do?
   * Who are you really competing with? (hint it's not just your direct competitors)
   * What is convincing people to try out your product/service?
   * What is stopping people from giving it a try? What is stopping them from buying?
   * What makes them quit?
   * What's your revenue potential?
   * Figure what you should build next (which features, new product ideas)
