#Make your ecommerce store better at making money#

##Last month, there were plenty of people that almost bought from you but they didn’t##

They were distracted, confused or just plain frustrated with the whole buying experience.

There were also a lot people who could have (and were willing to) spend more money with you if you just offered them a chance to do so.

Your site is probably doing less than average job when it comes to converting visitors into happy and paying a little more customers.
And because of that, every day that passes you by is a day of lost potential revenue (think about how much money that is on a yearly basis….).

But it doesn’t have to be that way, even small changes and improvements to your store can turn this around and bring you far more revenue in the future.
